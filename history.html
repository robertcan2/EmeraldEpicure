<div class="pad10">
     The history of olives and olive oil is rich with tales of wealth, value, and mores. The ancient Greeks considered olive oil as liquid gold. Everyone used the olive and it's oil in daily life. The olive was so important that laws were passed on who could harvest it, how much was allowed to be harvested and how it was to be preserved since it was considered an integral element to the nation's survival. Some cities in Greece forbade the cutting of olive trees. It was called a favorite food, a great therpeutic, and the most important fruit given to mankind.

      <br>

     In Rome, olive oil traders dedicated a statue and a temple to the god of olives. Both in Rome and Greece, common practices included olive oil used in washing one's hair, annointing the dead and applying olive oil to the skin. Ancient eye shadow was made from pulverized charcoal and olive oil.

     Athletes would apply olive oil and sand to their bodies to protect themselves from abrasion and heat. At the Grecian Olympic Games, olive oil was used to anoint athletes and victors of the games were given wreaths of olive leaves to wear. Olive oil has been used in the coronation of kings, rulers, and lesser leaders.

The bible has many references to the olive tree and olive oil. It is mentioned more than 170 times in the Bible. The olive tree was and is seen as a sign of peace. A dove was said to have brought an olive branch to Noah after the flood to indicate that he would find shore and be saved. The bible reports that King Solomon used olive oil as part payment for his temple. Olive wood is fragrant and was used for altars in ancient times.
